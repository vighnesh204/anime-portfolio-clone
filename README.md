## 🙌 Acknowledgments
Huge respect to Cynthia Ugwu for creating one of the most inspiring, elegant, and creatively engineered portfolio websites on the web.
Her original site sets a benchmark for modern web design, with mesmerizing scroll animations, a bold minimal aesthetic, and smooth user experience that reflects true mastery of interaction design.

This project is a humble attempt to recreate that brilliance, while learning advanced animation techniques and front-end implementation.
